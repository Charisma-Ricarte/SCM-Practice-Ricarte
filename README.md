## What is Software Configuration Management (SCM)?

Software Configuration Management (SCM) is the process of systematically controlling the changes made to software, including tracking and versioning of code. SCM ensures that software development is structured, consistent, and repeatable.

## How GitHub Helps with SCM

GitHub is a platform that uses Git, a distributed version control system, to manage and track changes in software projects. It allows multiple developers to collaborate, maintain a history of changes, and manage code in branches. GitHub provides tools for merging, branching, and issue tracking, making SCM easier and more efficient for teams.
